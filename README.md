# Empirical Evaluation of Autoencoder Models for Anomaly Detection in Packet-based NIDS

This repository contains the code for the project "Empirical Evaluation of Autoencoder Models for Anomaly Detection in Packet-based NIDS". The code and proposed framework are provided that can be used to reproduce our work for anomaly detection using Autoencoder in packet-based NIDS.
